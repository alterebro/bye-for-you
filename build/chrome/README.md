### üö´ Say goodbye to the ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù algorithm.

_**Bye "For You"**_ is a simple and lightweight browser extension that removes the *"For You"* tab from the top of your feed and switches you back to the *"Following"* tab so you follow only who you actually follow.

This extension does not collect any user data and operates solely on the page content of X.com. **No tracking, no data collection, no bloat**.
