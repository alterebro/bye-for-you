### Privacy Policy: X Tab Fixer

X Tab Fixer is a privacy-first browser extension which takes privacy seriously and commit to the following:

- It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
- It does not use cookies or trackers.
- It does not communicate with any servers.
- The extension works entirely on your device, modifying the interface of x.com locally.

This extension simply removes the “For You” tab and selects the “Following” tab on X (formerly Twitter) for a better user experience.
